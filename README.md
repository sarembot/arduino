This repository will be a place where I can share my journey into the world of Arduino, microcontrollers, and C programming.

Today, it will be the home of many simple programs written in the Arduino IDE. Eventually, I hope for it to be the home of some more complex projects. With sensors and stuff. Until that day, I'll be happily plugging along into the world of building with electronics.

Thank you for visiting.
